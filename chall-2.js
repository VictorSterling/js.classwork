//There are three things wrong with this code. Find them and explain why they are wrong.

let someNumber = 20;

someNumber = 20

// ANSWERS

//LET is the right word to use in place of CONST as the number "20" is a variable that is subject to change later in the codebase.

// Space is not expected to be between 'some' and 'Number' 

// someNumber equals "20" not "50" since that is what we called it to be.
