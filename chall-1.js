//In the dev tools console. figure out how to do the following (use google to help):

//create a boolean variale called 'myBoolean' and set to true.
let myBoolean = true

//create a string variable called 'myString' and set it to 'helloworld'.
let myString = "hello world"

//create a number variale called 'firstNumber' and set it equal to '20'.
let firstNumber = 20;

//create a number variale called 'secondNumber' and set it equal to '40'.
let secondNumber = 40;

//reassign second number and set it equal to '80'
secondNumber = 80;

//create an array called "myArray" and put 'myBoolean' at index 0, and myString at index 1.
// const myArray = [
//     index0 myBoolean;
//     index1 : myString;
// ]

//create an object called 'myObject' and assign 'myArray' to a property called 'firstProperty', and the sum of 'firstNumber' and 'secondNumber' to a property called 'sumProerty' (hint: we didn't cover how to do this here.)

const myObject = {
    firstProperty: myArray,
    sumProperty: firstNumber + secondNumber,
}

//Print 'myObect' to the console.
//"Not defined"

//Print the 'sumProperty' of 'myObject' to the console.

//Print the value at index 1 of 'firstProperty'.
