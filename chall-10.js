//What does expression5 evaluate to ? How could you write this in a single line of code (For exercise purposes only; you could never want to write all of this in a single line//)

const expression1 = 100 % 50;
const expression2 = 100 / 50;
const expression3 = expression1 < expression2;
const expression4 = expression3 && 300+5 === 305
const expression5 = !expression4;

console.log(expression5);

//===ANSWER===/ 
//expression5 is false
